You: i just need to [color=yellow]COMBINE[/color] them to create a [color=cyan]LETTER[/color]!
Outside of dialogue, you can press a number key to select an item from your inventory.
Pressing 1 selects the first item, and so on.
When an item is selected, you can select another item to try [color=yellow]COMBINING[/color] them.
